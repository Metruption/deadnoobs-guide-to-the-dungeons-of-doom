potions that are SUPER POWERFUL but can still be ported:

gain ability (roll 1d6 for permanent +1 to a stat, blessed = stat of choice, cursed = -1 to random)

gain level (tbh this might be too busted, probably don't want)



potions that are cool utility and would last for like 1 minute not just a round

monster detection

object detection

greater detection (both of the two above)

speed (already exists?)

levitation (already exists?)

invisibility (already exists?)

see invisible (already exists?)



more situational potions that are still super FUN

oil (greasespell)

acid (alchemical fire, but acid)

sleep (modified sleep spell with smaller aoe)

blindness (throw splash fuck i cant see shit!)

confusion

hallucination

polymorph (HONESTLY porting nethack polymorph rules to work with dnd 5e will be hard but so rewarding)

restore ability (uhh.... remove curse potion? kinda i guess... but not exactly)

clear potions HEHEHE

sickness

paralysis

... ^^ some of these would be usable as poisons





stuff idk ow to port

gain energy
