Yes, we're ok with you creating a supplement so long as it is not intended
as a means of generating revenue, either for yourself or others.  In
addition, we would request a clear disclaimer stating exactly which items
you are appropriating from NetHack, including the version as items do tend
to change between releases.  Finally, we would request that you include a
link to nethack.org and a note indicating that if anyone is interested in
NetHack, they should go there to download a current copy of the game for
their personal enjoyment.
