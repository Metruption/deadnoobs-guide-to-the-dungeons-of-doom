# deadnoob's Guide to the Dungeons of Doom

*A port of various bits from nethack to Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition*

## What is nethack?

Nethack is a game made by the [DevTeam](https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/DevTeam). If you wish to download a current copy of the game for your own personal enjoyment please go to their website at [nethack.org](https://nethack.org) where you can download a current copy of nethack for your personal enjoyment.s


## What is this?

This is a supplement for Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition. It is meant to be somewhat balanced for tables that I DM at. If you think that things need to be tweaked then go for it! It's your table and you can change the rules if you want. Keep in mind that some of these rules will radically change how Dungeons and Dragons is played. So BUCkle up and get ready to read.

## I want MOAR

Currently there is not much here. This is a list of things that will be here:

* Potions ported from nethack
* Wands ported from nethack
* Monsters ported from NetHack
* Rules ported from Nethack
* Internal consistency on the capitalization of nethack
